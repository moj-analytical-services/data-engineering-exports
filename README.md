# Data engineering exports

This repository lets you export data from the Analytical Platform to other platforms. For now, this means the HMPPS Performance Hub or the Ministry of Justice Cloud Platform. Message us on the #ask-data-engineering Slack channel if you want to connect to somewhere else.

## Ways to export

There are 2 ways to export your data:

- a 'push bucket', which will send any data you put in it to a bucket in another account
- a 'pull bucket', which is on the Analytical Platform but whose contents are visible to a specific external user

Both are fine in principle - your team may prefer one or the other. Contact us on the #ask-data-engineering Slack channel to discuss it.

At the moment pull buckets only work if the other platform is also on Amazon Web Services. It isn't currently an option for Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud Platform. But contact us if you need one of these - we can add it, it just hasn't been needed yet.


##Â Setting up exports

You can request either bucket type through this repository. The Analytical Platform has advice on [working with GitHub branches](https://user-guidance.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/github.html#working-on-a-branch).

This guide uses an example dataset called <<new_project>>. Wherever this appears, insert the name of your own dataset. Make sure you remove the <<>> - this is just to show you what to change.

Only use lower case and underscores in your dataset name.

1. Create a new branch in this repository called either `push_dataset/<<new_project>>` or `pull_dataset/<<new_project>>`
2. Create a new file in either `pull_datasets` or `push_datasets` called `new_project.yaml`
3. Add your project name, target bucket (the bucket you want the files to go to) and list of Analytical Platform usernames to the new file, like this:

``` yaml
  name: new_project
  bucket: target-bucket-name
  users:
    - alpha_user_one
    - alpha_user_two
```

4. For a pull dataset, you must also add the Amazon Web Services 'Arns' of the roles that should have access to the bucket. Talk to your Cloud Platform team to get these - or contact us to discuss it. Your config should end up looking like this:

``` yaml
  name: new_project
  pull_arns:
    - arn:aws:iam::1234567890:role/role-name-1
    - arn:aws:iam::1234567890:role/role-name-2
  users:
    - alpha_user_one
    - alpha_user_two
```

5. Commit the file and push it to GitHub
6. Create a new pull request and request a review from the data engineering team

The data engineering team will check your changes, deploy them and tell you when it's ready.


### Exporting data from a push bucket

The users in your dataset file will now have permission to add files to any path beginning with: `s3://mojap-hub-exports/new_project/`.

You must include the project name in the path. For example, you could write a file to `s3://mojap-hub-exports/new_project/my_data.csv`, but not to `s3://mojap-hub-exports/my_data.csv`.

For how to move files, see the Analytical Platform guide to [writing to an S3 bucket](https://user-guidance.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/data/data-faqs/#how-do-i-read-write-data-from-an-s3-bucket).

After you send files to this location they will be copied to your target bucket, then deleted from `mojap-hub-exports`.

## Exporting data from a pull bucket

You will be given a bucket called `mojap-new-project` - the name of your project, prefixed with `mojap` (this means it's managed by data engineering rather than the Analytical Platform team).

The users in your dataset file will have read and write access to this bucket.

The 'pull Arns' in your dataset file have read-only access to the bucket.
