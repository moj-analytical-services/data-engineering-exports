# Data engineering hub exports

This repository lets you export data from the Analytical Platform to the HMPPS Performance Hub. This should save you having to download your results and email people to get them on the Performance Hub.

##Â Getting permission to export

You can request permission through this repository. The Analytical Platform has advice on [working with GitHub branches](https://user-guidance.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/github.html#working-on-a-branch).

This guide uses an example dataset called 'new_project'. Wherever this appears, insert the name of your own dataset.

Only use lower case and underscores in your dataset name.

1. Create a new branch in this repository called `dataset/new_project`
2. Create a new file in the `datasets` directory called `new_project.yaml`
3. Add your project name and list of Analytical Platform usernames to the new file, like this:

``` yaml
  name: new_project
  users:
    - alpha_user_one
    - alpha_user_two
```

4. Commit the file and push it to GitHub
5. Create a new pull request and request a review from the data engineering team

The data engineering team will check your changes, deploy them and tell you when it's ready.


## Exporting data to the Performance Hub

The users in your dataset file will now have permission to add files to any path beginning with: `s3://mojap-hub-exports/new_project/`.

You must include the project name in the path. For example, you could write a file to `s3://mojap-hub-exports/new_project/my_data.csv`, but not to `s3://mojap-hub-exports/my_data.csv`.

For how to move files, see the Analytical Platform guide to [writing to an S3 bucket](https://user-guidance.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/data/data-faqs/#how-do-i-read-write-data-from-an-s3-bucket).

After you send files to this location they will be copied to the Performance Hub then deleted.
